PROBLEM STATEMENT
A directed acyclic graph is a family graph if the following constraints are all satisfied:

The nodes of the graph are numbered 0 through N-1, for some positive N.
Each node is either male or female.
Each node either has no parents, or it has precisely two parents. (A parent of the node x is a node y such that there is an edge from y to x.)
If a node has parents, their numbers are strictly smaller than the number of the node.
If a node has parents, one of them must be male and the other female.


You are given two int[]s parent1 and parent2 with N elements each.
These describe one directed graph that resembles a family graph:
For each i, node i has either two parents (in which case parent1[i] and parent2[i] are their numbers, and both of them are smaller than i), or it has no parents (in which case parent1[i] and parent2[i] are both -1).

Return "Possible" (quotes for clarity) if the given graph can be a family graph, and "Impossible" otherwise.

DEFINITION
Class:Family
Method:isFamily
Parameters:int[], int[]
Returns:String
Method signature:String isFamily(int[] parent1, int[] parent2)


CONSTRAINTS
-parent1 will contain between 1 and 100 elements, inclusive.
-parent1 and parent2 will contain the same number of elements.
-For each i, the i-th element (0-based) of parent1 will be between -1 and i-1, inclusive.
-For each i, the i-th element (0-based) of parent2 will be between -1 and i-1, inclusive.
-For each i, the i-th element of parent1 will be -1 if and only if the i-th element of parent2 is -1.
-For each i, if the i-th element of parent1 is not -1, then the i-th element of parent1 and the i-th element of parent2 will be different.


EXAMPLES

0)
{-1,-1,0}
{-1,-1,1}

Returns: "Possible"

The parents of node 2 are nodes 0 and 1. Nodes 0 and 1 have no parents.

1)
{-1,-1,-1,-1,-1}
{-1,-1,-1,-1,-1}

Returns: "Possible"

Nobody has any parents.

2)
{-1,-1,0,0,1}
{-1,-1,1,2,2}

Returns: "Impossible"

Given that 0 and 1 have a child, their genders must be different. Given that 0 and 2 have a child, their genders must be different, too. Then, 1 and 2 must have the same gender, hence they cannot have a child together. Therefore, this cannot be a valid family graph.

3)
{-1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,0,5,6,-1,0,3,8,6}

{-1,-1,-1,-1,3,-1,4,6,5,-1,5,4,6,1}


Returns: "Possible"



4)
{-1,-1,-1,2,2,-1,5,6,4,6,2,1,8,0,2,4,6,9,-1,16,-1,11}
{-1,-1,-1,1,0,-1,1,4,2,0,4,8,2,3,0,5,14,14,-1,7,-1,13}

Returns: "Impossible"
