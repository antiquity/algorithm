PROBLEM STATEMENT
The pony Rainbow Dash wants to choose her pet.
There are N animals who want to be her pet.
Rainbow Dash numbered them 0 through N-1.

To help her make the decision, Rainbow Dash decided to organize a relay race for the animals.
The race track is already known, and for each animal we know how fast it is.
More precisely, you are given int[]s A and B with the following meaning:
For each i, the animal number i will take between A[i] and B[i] seconds (inclusive) to complete the track.

For the race the animals will be divided into two competing teams.
This is a relay race, so the team members of each team will all run the same track, one after another --
when the first team member finishes, the second one may start, and so on.
Thus the total time in which a team completes the race is the sum of the times of all team members.
Note that we can use the estimates given by A and B to estimate the total time for any team of animals.

Given two teams S and T, the value maxdiff(S,T) is defined as the largest possible difference in seconds
between the time in which team S finishes the course and the time in which team T finishes the course.

Rainbow Dash now needs to assign each of the animals to one of the two competing teams.
She wants to see a close competition, so she wants the teams to finish as close to each other as possible.
Formally, she wants to divide all animals into teams S and T in a way that minimizes maxdiff(S,T).
Return the smallest possible value of maxdiff(S,T).

DEFINITION
Class:MayTheBestPetWin
Method:calc
Parameters:int[], int[]
Returns:int
Method signature:int calc(int[] A, int[] B)


NOTES
-The teams are not required to contain the same number of animals.


CONSTRAINTS
-A will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-A and B will contain the same number of elements.
-Each element of A will be between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.
-Each element of B will be between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.
-For each i, B[i] will be greater than or equal to A[i].


EXAMPLES

{3,4,4,7}
{3,4,4,7}

Returns: 2

In this test case we know the exact time in which each of the animals completes the track.
An optimal solution is to choose teams S={0,3} and T={1,2}.
Then team S will certainly complete the track in 3+7 = 10 seconds, and team T in 4+4 = 8 seconds.
Thus, maxdiff(S,T)=2.

1)
{1,3,5,4,5}
{2,5,6,8,7}

Returns: 5

Here one of the optimal solutions is S={2,3} and T={0,1,4}.
For these two teams we have maxdiff(S,T)=5.
For example, it is possible that S will complete the track in 6+8 = 14 seconds, and T will complete it in 1+3+5 = 9 seconds.
It is also possible that S will complete the track up to 5 seconds before T does.
