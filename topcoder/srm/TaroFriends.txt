PROBLEM STATEMENT

Cat Taro likes to play with his cat friends.
Each of his friends currently sits on some coordinate on a straight line that goes from the left to the right.
When Taro gives a signal, each of his friends must move exactly X units to the left or to the right.




You are given an int[] coordinates and the int X.
For each i, the element coordinates[i] represents the coordinate of the i-th cat before the movement.
Return the smallest possible difference between the positions of the leftmost cat and the rightmost cat after the movement.


DEFINITION
Class:TaroFriends
Method:getNumber
Parameters:int[], int
Returns:int
Method signature:int getNumber(int[] coordinates, int X)


CONSTRAINTS
-coordinates will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of coordinates will be between -100,000,000 and 100,000,000, inclusive.
-X will be between 0 and 100,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{-3, 0, 1}
3

Returns: 3

The difference 3 is obtained if the cats move from {-3,0,1} to {0,-3,-2}.




1)
{4, 7, -7}
5

Returns: 4

The difference 4 is obtained if the cats move from {4,7,-7} to {-1,2,-2}.




2)
{-100000000, 100000000}
100000000

Returns: 0



3)
{3, 7, 4, 6, -10, 7, 10, 9, -5}
7

Returns: 7



4)
{-4, 0, 4, 0}
4

Returns: 4



5)
{7}
0

Returns: 0
