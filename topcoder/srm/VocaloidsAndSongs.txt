PROBLEM STATEMENT
Vocaloids Gumi, Ia, and Mayu love singing.
They decided to make an album composed of S songs.
Each of the S songs must be sung by at least one of the three Vocaloids.
It is allowed for some songs to be sung by any two, or even all three Vocaloids at the same time.
The number of songs sang by Gumi, Ia, and Mayu must be gumi, ia, and mayu, respectively.

They soon realized that there are many ways of making the album.
Two albums are considered different if there is a song that is sung by a different set of Vocaloids.
Let X be the number of possible albums.
Since the number X can be quite large, compute and return the number (X modulo 1,000,000,007).
