PROBLEM STATEMENT
Dachshund is a popular dog breed. In this problem, a miniature dachshund is defined as a dachshund whose weight is not more than 5,000 grams.


Lun the miniature dachshund loves mikan (satsuma oranges). She has just bought some mikan. You are given a int[] mikan. It gives the weight of all mikan she bought. For each valid i, mikan[i] is the weight of the i-th mikan in grams.


You are also given an int weight. Currently, Lun weighs weight grams. When she eats i-th mikan, her weight increases by mikan[i] grams. If she eats multiple mikan, her weight increases by their total weight. She cannot eat just a part of a mikan. In other words, if she chooses to eat a mikan, she eats it completely.
