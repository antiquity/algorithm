PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are given a String S. The string can have up to 2500 characters.


You have to reverse exactly one substring of S. Formally, you have to choose two 0-based indices {x,y} such that x <= y, and then you have to reverse the order of the letters with indices x through y, inclusive. That is, S[x]S[x+1]...S[y] becomes S[y]...S[x+1]S[x].


For example, if S="abcdefg", you can choose the indices {2,5} to obtain "abfedcg", the indices {0,1} to obtain "bacdefg", or the indices {3,3} to obtain "abcdefg". (In the last example, only one letter was selected, so the string did not change.)


Your goal is to produce the lexicographically smallest string possible. Return a int[] containing two elements: the optimal indices x and y.
If there are multiple optimal choices, find the one with the smallest x.
If there are still multiple optimal choices, find the one with the smallest y.


DEFINITION
Class:SubstringReversal
Method:solve
Parameters:String
Returns:int[]
Method signature:int[] solve(String S)


NOTES
-Given two strings A and B of equal length, we say that A is lexicographically smaller than B if A has a smaller character than B at the first position where they differ.


CONSTRAINTS
-S will contain between 1 and 2500 elements, inclusive.
-Each character of S will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').


EXAMPLES

0)
"abdc"

Returns: {2, 3 }

Reverse "dc" to "cd".

1)
"aabbcc"

Returns: {0, 0 }

Nothing to reverse here, you cannot produce a lexicographically smaller string.

2)
"misof"

Returns: {0, 4 }

Reverse the entire string.

3)
"ivan"

Returns: {0, 2 }

Reverse "iva" to bring 'a' to the beginning.

4)
"thisseemstobeaneasyproblem"

Returns: {0, 13 }
