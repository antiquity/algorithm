PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel has an unweighted undirected connected graph G with N vertices.
The vertices are numbered 0 through N-1.
The graph has a special structure.
You are given its description in two int[]s V and sizes.
V contains a sequence of vertex numbers.
Note that some vertex numbers may occur in V multiple times.

For each valid i, let S[i] be the sum of the first i elements of sizes.
For example, if sizes={10,20,30} then S[0]=0, S[1]=10, S[2]=10+20=30, and S[3]=10+20+30=60.

The graph G that is described by V and sizes looks as follows:
For each valid i, consider all pairs (j,k) such that S[i] <= j < k < S[i+1].
For each such pair (j,k), our graph G contains an edge between the vertices V[j] and V[k].
There are no other edges in G, only those defined above.
You may assume that V and sizes are always such that the resulting graph G is connected.

For each pair of vertices, compute their distance.
Return the sum of all those distances.

DEFINITION
Class:CliqueGraph
Method:calcSum
Parameters:int, int[], int[]
Returns:long
Method signature:long calcSum(int N, int[] V, int[] sizes)


NOTES
-For some test cases, the correct return value may overflow a signed 32-bit integer variable.


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 2 and 2,500, inclusive.
-V will contain between 1 and 5,000 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of V will be between 0 and N-1, inclusive.
-sizes will contain between 1 and 2,500 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of sizes will be between 2 and N, inclusive.
-The sum of all elements of sizes will be equal to the number of elements in V.
-For each valid i, the elements V[S[i]], V[S[i]+1], ..., V[S[i+1]-1] will be distinct. (See the problem statement for the definition of S[i].)
-The graph G described by V and sizes will be connected.


EXAMPLES

{0,1,2,0,3}
{3,2}

Returns: 8

The graph looks as follows:

The distance between vertex 0 and vertex 1 : 1
The distance between vertex 0 and vertex 2 : 1
The distance between vertex 0 and vertex 3 : 1
The distance between vertex 1 and vertex 2 : 1
The distance between vertex 1 and vertex 3 : 2
The distance between vertex 2 and vertex 3 : 2
The sum is 8.
