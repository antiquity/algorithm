EXAMPLES

0)
"aabbacccc"

Returns: "abc"

Each of the three letters can be the winning letter.
Here is one possibility how 'a' can be the winning letter:
Let's number the players 0 through 8 in the order in which they appear in the input.
We can then play the game as follows:

Send away players 1 ('a') and 8 ('c').
Send away players 2 ('b') and 6 ('c').
Send away players 7 ('c') and 0 ('a').
Send away players 5 ('c') and 3 ('b').
The only player left is player 4 ('a'), hence 'a' is the winning letter.



1)
"aaaaaaaccdd"

Returns: "a"

Only letter 'a' can win.

2)
"ddabccadb"

Returns: "abcd"



3)
"aaabbb"

Returns: ""

No letter can win.


4)
"rdokcogscosn"

Returns: "cos"
