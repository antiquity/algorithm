PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel has a robot.
The robot is located on an infinite plane.
At the beginning, the robot starts at the coordinates (0, 0).
The robot can then make several steps.
The steps are numbered starting from 0.

In each step, Ciel must choose one of two directions for the robot: right (x coordinate increases) or up (y coordinate increases).
In step k, the robot will move 3^k units in the chosen direction.
It is not allowed to skip a step.

You are given ints x and y.
Return "Possible" (quotes for clarity) if it is possible that the robot reaches the point (x,y) after some (possibly zero) steps.
Otherwise, return "Impossible".

DEFINITION
Class:PowerOfThreeEasy
Method:ableToGet
Parameters:int, int
Returns:String
Method signature:String ableToGet(int x, int y)


CONSTRAINTS
-x will be between 0 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
