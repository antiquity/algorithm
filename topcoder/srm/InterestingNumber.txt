PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel thinks that the number 41312432 is interesting.
This is because of the following property:
There is exactly 1 digit between the two 1s, there are exactly 2 digits between the two 2s, and so on.


Formally, Ciel thinks that a number X is interesting if the following property is satisfied:
For each D between 0 and 9, inclusive, X either does not contain the digit D at all, or it contains exactly two digits D, and there are precisely D other digits between them.


You are given a String x that contains the digits of a positive integer.
Return "Interesting" if that integer is interesting, otherwise return "Not interesting".
