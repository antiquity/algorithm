PROBLEM STATEMENT
Limit is a flea. He can do two types of jumps: small jumps that have length 1 millimeter, and big jumps that have length B millimeters.

Limit is going to make exactly T jumps, all of them in the same direction. He would like to travel exactly D millimeters in those jumps. Is this possible?

You are given a long D, and ints T and B. Return "Possible" (quotes for clarity) if there is a combination of T jumps forward that has a total length of exactly D millimeters. Otherwise, return "Impossible".
