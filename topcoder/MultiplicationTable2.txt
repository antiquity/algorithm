PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel is creating a new binary operation.

The operation will be denoted $ and it will be defined on the finite set S = {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}.
I.e., for each ordered pair (i, j) of elements of S the operation (i $ j) will return some element of S.

For example, we can have S = {0, 1}, and we can define that (0 $ 0) = 0, (0 $ 1) = 1, (1 $ 0) = 0, and (1 $ 1) = 0.

Note that Ciel's operation is not necessarily symmetric.
In other words, it is possible that for some i and j the operations (i $ j) and (j $ i) return two different values.

A nice concise description of the operation $ is its "multiplication table": a square table where in row i and column j we have the value (i $ j).
You are given this "multiplication table" encoded as a int[] table with n^2 elements.
For each valid i and j the operation (i $ j) returns the value table[i*n+j].

A subset T of S is called good if it has the following property:
for any two elements i and j in T, (i $ j) is also in T.

Find and return the minimal size of a good subset of S.
Note that the answer is always defined, as there always are some good subsets.
For example, the entire set S is always good.

DEFINITION
Class:MultiplicationTable2
Method:minimalGoodSet
Parameters:int[]
Returns:int
Method signature:int minimalGoodSet(int[] table)


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-table will contain exactly n*n elements.
-Each element in table will be between 0 and n-1, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,1,2,3,
 1,0,3,2,
 2,0,1,3,
 1,2,3,0}

Returns: 2

The smallest Good set is {0,1}, we can verify:

0 $ 0 = 1
0 $ 1 = 1
1 $ 0 = 1
1 $ 1 = 0



1)
{0,1,2,3,
 1,2,3,0,
 2,3,0,1,
 3,0,1,2}

Returns: 1

This time the answer is 1 since {0} is a Good set.

2)
{1,1,1,1,
 2,2,2,2,
 3,3,3,3,
 0,0,0,0}

Returns: 4

Now the only Good set is {0,1,2,3}.

3)
{0}

Returns: 1
