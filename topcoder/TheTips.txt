PROBLEM STATEMENT
The "Tips" game is played by a single player in a room full of stuff.
Before the game, the game master has hidden N clues somewhere in the room.
The clues are numbered 0 through N-1.
Your task is to find as many of these clues as possible.


The probability that you'll find clue i without any information is probability[i] percent.
Each clue you'll find will tell you the locations of some clues.
If you already know the location of a clue you are certain to find it.


You are given a String[] clues with the information on the content of the clues.
For each valid i and j, clues[i][j] will be either 'Y' or 'N'.
Here, 'Y' means that clue i contains the location of clue j, and 'N' means that it does not.
You are also given the int[] probability.


Compute and return the expected number of clues you will find during the game.


DEFINITION
Class:TheTips
Method:solve
Parameters:String[], int[]
Returns:double
Method signature:double solve(String[] clues, int[] probability)


NOTES
-The return value is correct if the relative error or the absolute error is at most 1e-9.
-You can follow the link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value for extra information about expected value.


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-clues and probability will contain exactly N elements each.
-Each element of clues will contain exactly N characters.
-Each character of each element of clues will be 'Y' or 'N'.
-Each element of probability will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"Y"}
{50}

Returns: 0.5

There is only one clue. You will find it with probability 0.5. Hence, the expected number of clues you'll find is 0.5.

1)
{"YN","NY"}
{100,50}

Returns: 1.5

Here, each clue only contains the (useless) information about its own location. You are certain to find clue 0 and you will only find clue 1 with probability 0.5.

2)
{"YYY","NYY","NNY"}
{100,0,0}

Returns: 3.0

You are certain to find clue 0. This clue will tell you the locations of the two remaining clues and thus you will be able to find those too.

3)
{"NNN","NNN","NNN"}
{0,0,0}

Returns: 0.0

You will not find any clue.

4)
{"NYYNYYNNNN","NNNNYNNNYN","YNNYYYYYNN","YYNYNNNNYN","NYNNNNNNNY","YNYYNNYNNY","NYNNYYYYYY","NYYYYNNNNN","YYNYNNYYYN","NNYYNYNYYY"}

{11,66,99,37,64,45,21,67,71,62}


Returns: 9.999891558057332



5)
{"NNY","NNY","NNN"}
{50, 50, 1}

Returns: 1.7525

In order to find clue 2 you need to find at least one of the clues 0 and 1, or you need to be really lucky.
