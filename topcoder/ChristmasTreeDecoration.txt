PROBLEM STATEMENT

Christmas is just around the corner, and Alice just decorated her Christmas tree.
There are N stars on the tree.
The stars are numbered 1 through N.
Additionally, each star has some color.
You are given the colors of stars as a int[] col with N elements.
For each i, col[i] is the color of star i+1.
(Different integers represent different colors.)



Alice has prepared N-1 ribbons and she is now going to attach them to the tree.
Each ribbon will connect two of the stars.
The ribbons have to be placed in such a way that all stars and ribbons will hold together.
(In other words, in the resulting arrangement the stars and ribbons will correspond to vertices and edges of a tree.)



Only some pairs of stars can be connected by a ribbon.
You are given a list of all such pairs of stars in two int[]s: x and y.
For each valid i, it is possible to add a ribbon that connects the stars with numbers x[i] and y[i].



According to Alice, a ribbon that connects two stars that share the same color is less beautiful than a ribbon that connects two stars with different colors.
Therefore, she would like to minimize the number of ribbons that connect two same-colored stars.
Compute and return the smallest possible number of such ribbons.


DEFINITION
Class:ChristmasTreeDecoration
Method:solve
Parameters:int[], int[], int[]
Returns:int
Method signature:int solve(int[] col, int[] x, int[] y)


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 2 and 50, inclusive.
-The number of elements in col will be N exactly.
-The number of elements in x will be between 1 and 200, inclusive.
-The number of elements in y will be the same as the number of elements in x.
-All elements of x and y will be between 1 and N, inclusive.
-For each i, the numbers x[i] and y[i] will be different.
-All unordered pairs (x[i], y[i]) will be distinct.
-There will be at least one way to choose N-1 ribbons that form a connected graph.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,1,2,2}
{1,2,3,4}
{2,3,4,1}

Returns: 1

We have four stars. Stars 1 and 2 have the same color, and stars 3 a 4 have the same color.
There are four pairs of stars we may connect: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-1.
One optimal solution is to use the following ribbons: 2-3, 3-4, and 4-1.
Two of these are beautiful (2-3 and 4-1) and only one (3-4) is not beautiful.

1)
{1,1,2,2}
{1,2,3,4,1,2}
{2,3,4,1,3,4}

Returns: 0

Now we can have three beautiful ribbons.

2)
{50,50,50,50}
{1,2,3,1,1,2}
{2,3,4,4,3,4}

Returns: 3

All stars have the same color. Regardless of how we attach the ribbons, none of them will be beautiful.

3)
{1,4,2,3}
{1,2,3}
{2,3,4}

Returns: 0



4)
{1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4}
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,1,1,1,1,1}
{2,3,1,5,6,4,8,9,7,11,12,10,5,7,12,11,6,4}

Returns: 5
